  As with the last few posts, I am finishing off the part runs for 8 Cubes, 
  This leads to 16 modules: 8 electrical modules and 8 mechanical modules.. 
  Five of these are 3D printers, one for the array and 4 for various kinds of
  testing  All the driveshaftsThe four pieces of stock, and additional parts to
  make the "Z" axis   All in all, quite a lot of grunt work to get all the
  setups together, cut the stock, prep the fixturing, write, then validate the
  Gcode, run the parts, deburr, drill and tap, deburr... I REALLY look forward
  to the automation part... ;-)        But grinding through this portion is
  helping to shape how the modular fixturing for the milling machine will need
  to look if a robot is going to have to set it up  4 sets of modules and
  frames      A lot of work, for an automated, form factor based, self
  extending, recursive, on-demand network of inter-operable manufacturing
  machines, but probably worth it... ;-)

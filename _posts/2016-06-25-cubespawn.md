  The small sizes will focus on capability and affordability, the trade-off
  being size (smaller build envelopes) the machines in the 600mm range are
  comparable in size to the existing maker/hacker built CNC's and 3D printers,
  but we plan to eventually offer higher end servo drives and advanced motion
  control, to allow higher performance designs in addition to stepper based
  models.

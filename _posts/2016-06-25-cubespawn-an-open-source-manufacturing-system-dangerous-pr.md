  Posted on Wednesday, June 29th, 2011 in Uncategorized by Ian CubeSpawn open
  source manufacturing system: Eventually it will have a metal cutting milling
  machine, a lathe, a surface grinder, a RepRap module and many other
  capabilities. It is completely open source and my goal is that whoever decide
